GTA_PHP_LEARNPHPCOURSE
======================

Meetup.com Self-Study Course Getting Started with PHP

This course will feature all of the work and assignments I will be working through for the 
GTA PHP User Group Learn PHP Course.  It will use Larry Ullman's "PHP for the Web" 4th Edition 
as the resource text.  

Feel free to look at and comment on any of the listed files directly, but preferably on the meetup.com GTA PHP User Group site under this particular course where I'll be active.
